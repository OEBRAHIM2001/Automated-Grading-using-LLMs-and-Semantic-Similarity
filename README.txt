This is a description of each Jupyter file, the version of Python used was 3.10.13.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. BERT Model - Automatic Grading (Dataset 1): This was the BERT model used for the first dataset, it includes the automatic grading results based on cosine similarity, Euclidean, and Manhattan distances. No fine-tuning included.

2. GPT-2 Model - Automatic Grading (Dataset 1): This was the GPT-2 model used for the first dataset, it includes the automatic grading results based on cosine similarity, Euclidean, and Manhattan distances. No fine-tuning included.

3. Finely-Tuned BERT Model - Automatic Grading (Dataset 1): This is a BERT Model, this time finely-tuned using LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation). It includes the automatic grading results based on cosine similarity, Euclidean, and Manhattan distances.

4. Finely-Tuned GPT-2 Model - Automatic Grading (Dataset 1): This is a GPT-2 Model, this time finely-tuned using LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation). It includes the automatic grading results based on cosine similarity, Euclidean, and Manhattan distances for the FIRST dataset.

5. Finely-Tuned BERT Model - Automatic Grading & Plagiarism Detection (Dataset 2): This is a finely-tuned using LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation). It includes the automatic grading results in Part A based on cosine similarity for the SECOND dataset in Python. It also includes plagiarism detection in Part B.

5. Finely-Tuned GPT-2 Model - Automatic Grading (Dataset 2): This is a GPT-2 Model, this time finely-tuned using LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation). It includes the results based on cosine similarity distances for the SECOND dataset.
